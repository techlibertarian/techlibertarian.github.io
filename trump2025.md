# The Looming Threats to Democracy and Privacy in a Rapidly Changing World
Early 2025 saw a dramatic shift in global politics when Donald Trump returned to the White House, propelled by a substantial infusion of campaign funds from Elon Musk. Reports of Musk donating over one hundred million dollars ignited debate about the role of wealthy individuals in shaping electoral outcomes. On the president’s first day in office, the United States withdrew from the World Health Organization and the Paris Agreement, moves that reverberated worldwide. At the same time, Trump pardoned more than a thousand people convicted for storming the Capitol in his previous term, including those serving lengthy prison sentences for violent acts. A sweeping executive order recognized only two genders and expanded what the administration termed “free speech” in discussions around that definition. These actions signaled a firm pivot toward a new political era and left many apprehensive about democratic stability in the years to come.

In an era defined by rapid technological advancement and shifting geopolitical landscapes, the interplay between technology, politics, and societal structures has become more evident—and more dangerous—than ever. As we navigate this complex web of challenges, it is critical to explore the risks of a rising authoritarian wave, the erosion of privacy, and the dangers posed by unchecked technological powers. This article reflects on these themes, incorporating a synthesis of concerns voiced in various forums and historical insights.

## The New World Order: A Rising Risk?
The term "New World Order" evokes a sense of foreboding. While historically associated with post-war political restructuring or conspiracy theories, today it symbolizes the rapid evolution of power dynamics. From Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency and Elon Musk’s growing influence to the global spread of far-right ideologies, signs of this shift abound.

Musk’s control of X (formerly Twitter) and his influence over media and technology give him unprecedented power to shape narratives. His alliances with far-right political figures in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe, coupled with his stated disdain for governmental structures, exemplify the consolidation of power into the hands of a few. Such actions have far-reaching consequences, as they amplify divisive ideologies and undermine democratic institutions.

Trump’s recent actions, including pardoning Capitol rioters and withdrawing from international agreements like the Paris Accord and the WHO, further highlight this danger. These moves align with a broader trend: a growing authoritarianism in the West. As political pendulums swing to extremes, there is a risk that democratic norms may erode faster than expected.

## Technology: A Double-Edged Sword
One of the defining features of this new age is the role of technology as both an enabler and a threat. AI, initially heralded as a tool for progress, now poses profound risks. Its ability to generate propaganda and manipulate public opinion has already been weaponized. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, Brexit, and Trump’s election were test cases for how data can be exploited to sway political outcomes.

Mikko Hyppönen, a cybersecurity expert, warned over two decades ago: “Privacy is not about having something to hide, but about control of the government. You might trust your current government, but think about all future governments.” His words remain prophetic. With surveillance tools like Chat Control 1.0 in the EU and mass data collection practices in China, governments are gaining unprecedented access to private lives. This access, when coupled with AI, can suppress dissent and marginalize vulnerable groups, leaving no room for resistance.

## The Fascist Resurgence in Europe and Beyond
The rise of far-right parties in Europe, such as Sweden Democrats (SD) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), mirrors a global trend. These parties are adept at exploiting media to propagate their ideologies, often overshadowing traditional parties. Platforms like YouTube have become battlegrounds for propaganda, reaching millions with targeted content.

The echoes of fascism are evident in policies that target marginalized groups, from immigrants to the LGBTQ+ community. As rights are stripped away under the guise of tradition or security, society becomes increasingly polarized. Surveillance, once justified as a means to combat crime or terrorism, may soon be used to persecute these groups further.

Some analysts argue that political extremes are part of a cyclical “Overton Window,” where public opinion shifts between left and right over generations. The Strauss-Howe generational theory similarly suggests societies pass through high-conflict periods before stabilizing. These frameworks can offer hope that backlash to far-right or fascist tendencies might eventually curb or reverse them. However, such theoretical cycles are no guarantee in the face of unprecedented AI-driven manipulation.

## A Digital Battlefield
The internet, once a bastion of free expression, has become a contested space. With Elon Musk’s potential acquisition of platforms like TikTok, the concentration of media ownership raises concerns. If AI-generated content dominates 99% of online discourse, opposing views may be effectively erased. The implications are staggering: traditional critical thinking may no longer suffice when alternative perspectives are entirely absent.

This digital battlefield is not new. Russia’s so-called "troll factories" and propaganda campaigns have already demonstrated the power of disinformation. The storming of the U.S. Capitol and the Brexit vote exemplify the tangible impact of online manipulation. In Sweden, investigative reports reveal that SD operated its own troll factory, further fueling the party's rise.

Yuval Noah Harari, historian and philosopher, has repeatedly drawn attention to the ways in which data and advanced algorithms can shape everything from personal beliefs to voting patterns. He emphasizes that individual autonomy is threatened when governments and corporations gain the power to profile citizens at a granular level, a capability that can be weaponized to influence choices, sway elections, and potentially steer entire nations toward authoritarian governance. In Harari’s view, the key lies in ensuring that those who create and manage these technologies remain accountable to transparent public processes rather than private or political interests.

## Learning from History, Preparing for the Future
History shows that authoritarian regimes and societal collapses do not happen overnight. Rome fell over centuries, not years. Yet, the rapid pace of technological advancement and global interconnectedness mean that today’s changes occur at unprecedented speed. The rise of AI, coupled with the erosion of privacy, accelerates this process, potentially shortening the warning signs we might otherwise expect.

A biblical parable describes ten maidens waiting for a bridegroom—five who kept extra oil for their lamps and five who did not. Those who planned ahead could see in the darkness; those who did not were left outside when the bridegroom finally arrived. Knowledge and vigilance are the oil for our lamps in this darkening world, and those who are unprepared may find themselves locked out of the future they hoped for. 

## What Can Be Done?

Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, focuses on the design principles that make social media so addictive and divisive. He has warned that algorithmic incentives often prioritize conflict and sensationalism because they increase user engagement, a model that can be exploited by political factions seeking to amplify extreme views. Harris urges redesigning digital platforms to serve the public interest, rather than commodifying users’ time and attention. He believes that if these platforms shift their core metrics from profit-driven attention-grabbing to genuine civic engagement, they could help revitalize democratic discourse rather than erode it.

**Limit Digital Vulnerability**: As privacy erodes, individuals must take steps to protect their online presence. Avoiding platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, which are tied to data-hungry corporations, is a prudent start. Consider privacy-focused messaging apps and web services.

**Educate and Advocate**: Awareness is key. Discussions about privacy, propaganda, and democracy must become mainstream. Encouraging critical thinking in schools and communities can help counteract misinformation. Equip individuals—especially younger generations—with tools to discern misinformation from fact.

**Demand Transparent Governance**: Advocate for clear, enforceable regulations on AI and data collection. Push for oversight mechanisms to ensure that surveillance powers are not exploited for political gain.

**Support Democratic Institutions**: Vote. Engage in local community initiatives. Watchdog organizations and independent media outlets can help hold power to account.

**Build Resilient Communities**: Strengthen offline social networks that are not reliant on centralized digital platforms. Local groups and neighborhood solidarity can be vital buffers against online echo chambers.

## A Call to Action
The threats we face are immense, but so too is our capacity for resilience. As Martin Luther once said, “If I knew the world would end tomorrow, I would still plant a tree today.” In this spirit, we must balance vigilance with hope. By staying informed, speaking out, and supporting democratic values, we can preserve the freedoms that define us.

The war for democracy and privacy is ongoing. The first step in fighting it is recognizing that we are all participants in this conflict. Whether through the platforms we use, the votes we cast, or the discussions we engage in, we shape the future. Are we prepared, or will we be caught unawares?
